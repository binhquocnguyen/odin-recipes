THIS IS MY RECIPE WEBSITE FOR HTML AND CSS BASICS.

I started building the web first, with HTML, and CSS after that. Until finishing the web, I then started with Git and GitHub. Therefore, up until this point that I began pushing my work to GitHub, and that is the reason why the commit history contains few commits than it supposed to.

Thank you for visiting!
